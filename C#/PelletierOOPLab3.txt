This app allows the creation of new lines with a container via the inputs on the left. The buttons allow a few options 
for control, the clear will clear all text in the container, add will add the text within the inputs as one line into the
container and the save button will save the file to an output destination on the users computer than display whether successful
or not and where it saved to.
